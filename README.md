Share Manifold Ventilator

##Summary
The Shared Manifold Ventilator (SMV) is a ventilator design that achieves low cost per
patient and uses commercially available parts for quick assembly. One of the ways the
SMV reduces cost is by consolidating pressure regulation. There are three manifolds
which can link to any patient in the shared ventilation ward. The pressure in those
manifolds is carefully controlled. But the cost of this control per patient is dramatically
less because one is controlling a manifold serving perhaps a hundred patients.
Each patient is linked to an oxygen manifold, an air manifold, and an exhaust manifold
through normally closed solenoid valves. These manifolds are made of a large diameter
pipe, ~2-3" such that the pressure on the manifold is nearly constant for all the patients
linked to that manifold. By varying the time that the oxygen solenoid valve is open
versus the air solenoid valve, the effective oxygen concentration for each patient can be
controlled individually. The breathing cycle is also individually controllable.
It is possible to enable patient-triggered inhalation as is desirable for most COVID-19
patients.
